For the Bash challenges, you're going to need /Bash/sapphirectf_vm.ova. This VM contains challenges Bash 1-9. FTP & SSH are installed on their default ports on this device, as well as VirtualBox Guest Additions. This way you can achieve file transfer. FTP Username & Password is:

FTP Username: upload
FTP Password: access_ftp

The user account to access the FTP folder is:

FTP Folder Username: ctf_ftp
FTP Folder Password: access_ftp

The username of each challenge is ctf_bash_<Bash challenge number>. Your first challenge has these creds:

Username: ctf_bash_1
Password: lets_go

Every challenge’s account’s password is the previous challenge’s flag. If this challenge’s flag was shc{dogs} then the next challenges creds would be:

Username: ctf_bash_2
Password: shc{dogs}

Each challenge is intended to go in sequential order but this is not required. The vm_admin account is not apart of the challenges.
