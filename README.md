# SapphireCTF
Sapphire CTF is a beginners-level CTF developed by a student, with categories such as Bash, Crypto, Trivia, and more.

The CTF was originally made by the Sapphire Development Group to create a challenge for Sapphire Hacking & Coding's community. Since the shutdown of Sapphire Development Group, the challenges were left unused. The puzzles were up on a CTFd site for a while, and now they're at their longer home on GitHub.
